# How all the stuff is structured

* `OII` contains all the excercises about Italian Olympiad in Informatics I've been doing which can be found in the [Italian 
CMS](https://cms.di.unipi.it)
* `Codeforces` contains all the excersises which can be found on Codeforces. The structure is: X/Y, where X is the contest number and Y the division. Better layouts are welcome.
* `UVa` contains all the excersises (still no-one by now) figuring in the University of Valladolid website
* `IOI` contains all the excersises (still no-one by now) figuring in the IOI website.
